# SudokuSolver
Intro level Sudoku solving java program

This java program will print out a solution to a given sudoku puzzle that is entered into the program as a 2D array.
It will loop through each spot row by row and attempt numbers that are feasible using row/col/box constraint methods,
using a backtracking alogorithm if encountering an impossible leftover range of numbers. It will print out this result 
to the console using formatted text. Additionally, it will display the average "guesses" between 1-8 for each 0 value
that is solved.
